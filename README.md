# TowerDefense
Project for Object-Oriented Programming classes at WUT

Basically, the game is supposed to be a weird tower defense.  
There is a number of items with randomized positions on the map - these are the points you are supposed to guard.  
Enemy minions approach from all sides of the map, they are after your items - if they manage to get to an item, they pick it up and try to run away.  
If they are succesful - player loses HP.
